## Description

This is a Web API application that shares and stores data regarding pets logged at the Animal Shelter. Following full CRUD functionality, users can access the data, update pets, delete pets, and create new pets. This API utilizes pagination to limit the number of results given at a time when a user makes a request to see a list of all pets. A set list of pets are seeded into the database upon download, and can be removed if needed.
